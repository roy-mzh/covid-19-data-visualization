1. Please make sure there is enough space under RStudio working directory.
Otherwise, it will report an error like "MemoryAllocationError" when generating .gif file.

2. Please run "x = query()" without using any UIC campus WIFI. Otherwise, it will fail(Hotspot is OK!)
If you cannot run this block to get the data anyway, you can open a copy of the data that used in my part. 
("data_1930026096.csv")

3.  Please change all the load in path and output path to your own path in .rmd file. Otherwise it will fail.

4.  All the generated images and .gif files of my part are saved under the folder "result_1930026096"

5. All the input data and copy of my part are saved under folder "data_1930026096"

## The code should be run normally. If there is anything wrong, please contect me by my wechat:
